### Configure .env file

1. Open terminal and navigate to the project folder
2. Run `cp .env.example .env`
3. Fill in the .env file with the details that you have gathered in the previous steps

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=<<Afffinidi's API Key>>
REACT_APP_API_KEY_HASH=<<Affinidi's API Key Hash>>
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=prod
PORT=3001
```
